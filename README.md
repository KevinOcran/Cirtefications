All the cirtefications and Accomplishmets I have and will have

Prompt Engineering for Developers by OpenAi and DeepLearning.Ai

Over view:
Learn the fundamentals of prompt engineering for ChatGPT. Learn effective prompting, and how to use LLMs for summarizing, inferring, transforming, and expanding.

Personal reflection:
The course is it insightful does something a lot of "Prompt Engineering  courses" fail To do. They for one thing, teach you how to use LLM API's  which is great since with this, you can create custom chatbots like  chatGPT itself. Any ways, I'm blabbing too much check it out for  Yourself.
